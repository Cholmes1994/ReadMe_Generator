# ReadMe_Generator

# Description

    This project uses node.js to create a ReadMe for the user.
    
    The way that this project works is, the user opens the index.js file in the terminal and then proceeds to run it.

    Once ran, the terminal prompts the user for answers to a variety of questions that will fill out each section of the ReadMe.

    Most of the questions are of the "input" type and there is one question that is of the "checkbox" type.

    Once the user fills out all of the questions, we use the fs.writeFile method to display those answer on a markdown file.

# Installation

    The generator requires that you install "inquirer" as well "fs".

    Use npm install to obtain these.

# Usage

    Open the index.js file in the terminal, use the command "node index.js" to begin, then fill out the following questions.
